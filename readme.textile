h1. bUpload

h2. Introduction

This mod will upload screen shots from in game straight to www.imgur.com. Once it has uploaded the image it will paste a link to the image into your chat. bUpload is multi-threaded, so while the image is uploading you can continue playing Minecraft as normal. bUpload does not save your file locally, it just uploads the image straight to imgur for safe storage, making it easy to share images with friends and post them on forums.
